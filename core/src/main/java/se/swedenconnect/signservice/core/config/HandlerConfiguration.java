 * handler by manually assigning all of its required configuration data without the use of a
 * {@code HandlerConfiguration} data object. The {@code HandlerConfiguration} is intended to be used when SignService
 * handlers are configured, and created in an application from properties, or YML-files, for example using Spring Boot
 * or Quarkus.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Each class implementing the {@code HandlerConfiguration} must tell which {@link HandlerFactory} class that
 * understands its settings and can be used to create a handler based on the configuration. See {@link #getFactoryClass()}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: An implementing class must not assign a default value for any property. Non-assigned properties must always
 * return {@code null}. Assignment of default values should be done in the corresponding factory class.
