 * Defines the handler interface for user authentication.

 * Since the handler interface supports authentication schemes that can authenticate the user "in
 * one go" and schemes that require that the user is directed to a remote authentication service
 * (IdP) there are two methods defined:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>authenticate><b> - Initiates the authentication operation with the supplied authentication
 * requirements and the supplied session context. If the authentication can be performed without
 * directing the user to a remote authentication service the result is delivered directly in the
 * result object ({@link AuthenticationResult#getAssertion()}. If the user needs to be directed to a
 * remote authentication service the result object will contain the HTTP request object, see
 * {@link AuthenticationResult#getHttpRequestMessage()}. In these cases, the authentication process
 * is resumed by invoking {@code resumeAuthentication}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>resumeAuthentication</b> - In the cases where a call to {@code authenticate} led to the user
 * being directed to a remote authentication service, this method resumes the authentication
 * process. Depending on the flow of the implemented authentication scheme the
 * {@code resumeAuthentication}Â may have to be invoked several times.
