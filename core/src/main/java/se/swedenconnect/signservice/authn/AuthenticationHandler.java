 * that require that the user is directed to a remote authentication service (IdP) there are two methods defined:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>authenticate><b> - Initiates the authentication operation with the supplied authentication requirements and the
 * supplied session context. If the authentication can be performed without directing the user to a remote
 * authentication service the result is delivered directly in the result object
 * {@link AuthenticationResultChoice#getAuthenticationResult()} If the user needs to be directed to a remote
 * authentication service the result object will contain the HTTP request object, see
 * {@link AuthenticationResultChoice#getHttpRequestMessage()}. In these cases, the authentication process is resumed by
 * invoking {@code resumeAuthentication}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>resumeAuthentication</b> - In the cases where a call to {@code authenticate} led to the user being directed to a
 * remote authentication service, this method resumes the authentication process. Depending on the flow of the
 * implemented authentication scheme the {@code resumeAuthentication}Â may have to be invoked several times.
